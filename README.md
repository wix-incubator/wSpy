## Introduction
Smart log for sync and async operation and operation queues with stack-traces for debugging.

wSpy also helps you debug non-debuggable interactions, like drag, long hovering etc.

## Getting Started:
1. Add wSpy to your project:  
    ```
    $ npm i --save wspy
    ```
    or:
    ```
    $ yarn add wspy
    ```
2. Require `wSpy` in your file:  
    ```
    const wSpy = require('wspy')
    ```
3. Add logs to main points in your code:
    ```
    wSpy.log(logName, [functionName, arguments])
    ```


## Usage

#### Logging system
With wSpy you can log where ever you want.
  
Each log gives you the following:
* Log name
* Log index  
* Memory usage
* Source (stacktrace)
* Time (seconds and ms)
* Record (you can log arguments for functions and view them in each log)

wSpy works with several platforms: Node, browser and worker.

#### wSpy settings:
Define in your code the settings for wSpy config. If not defined, wSpy would use it own default config:
```
{
    includeLogs: '',             // Default logs for wSpy. Must define it when initiating!
    moreLogs: '',                // Logs that would only work if defined in wSpy param
    extraIgnoredEvents: [],      // Events not to log
    MAX_LOG_SIZE: 10000,         // Maximum log count. When reaching, wSpy would start deleting each log for the new to come
    DEFAULT_LOGS_COUNT: 300,     // Default count for grouped, purge and recent functionalities.
    GROUP_MIN_LEN: 5,            // Default min length for grouped functionality.
    stackFilter: /wSpy/i         // Stacktrace filter using regex. Recommended when working with minified libraries: react-dom, require.min.js etc.
}
```

In your code, define your overrided settings, for example:
```
const wSpySettings = {
    includeLogs: 'mainPointSystem,actionRunner',
    stackFilter: /wSpy|react-dom|bundle.js|min.js/i
}
```
#### Browser:
wSpy would be activated if you have wSpy param in your url. The values are `moreLogs` from wSpy config above, for example:  

```
wSpy=moreLog1,moreLog2
```

The logs in the url 

You can also omit some logs with `-logName`:

```
wSpy=-log1,-log2
```
Initiate with:

```
const wSpy = require('wspy').initBrowserHost({ settings })
```

#### Node:
In node host you don't have any url for wSpy param, so you must init wSpy with overrided param:
```
const wSpyParam = '&wSpy=moreLog1,-logName2'
```
Initiate wSpy:
```
const wSpy = require('wspy').initNodeHost({ settings, wSpyParam })
```

#### Worker:
In node host you don't have any url for wSpy param, so you must init wSpy with overrided param:
```
const wSpyParam = '&wSpy=moreLog1,-logName2'
```
Initiate wSpy:
```
const wSpy = require('wspy').initWorkerHost({ settings, wSpyParam })
```

#### Logging
```
.
.
.
function mainPointSystem(arg1, arg2) {
    wSpy.log('mainPointSystem', ['mainPointDef', ...arguments])
    .
    .
    .
}
```
#### Actions logging:
In modern system there are queues and runners for sync / async functions and handlers. `wSpy` gives you a way to log each function registration and execution:
  
ActionQueue:
```
.
.
.
function actionQueueRegistration(action) {
    wSpy.logCallBackRegistration(action, 'registerAction', [action.name || action], 'ActionQueue')
    .
    .
    .
}

function actionQueueExecution(action) {
    wSpy.logCallBackExecution(action, 'runAction', [action.name || action], 'ActionQueue')
    .
    .
    .
}
```

## Troubleshooting
Whenever wSpy has failed loading, it returns `noopSpy` - and log on your production code won't do nothing (either log or break).

Keep in mind for each new log you're adding, add to `moreLogs` the logName in your wSpy settings config.

Log only when needed, making a lot of logs would slow your system when debugging (of course not on production when wSpy isn't activated), and reviewing huge amount of logs isn't efficient.  

## Debugging
When you have finished adding logs in your system, you can run your code (add the url param if needed) and see your system logs. For example, on browser you can search for wSpy variable the the console, with `wSpy.logs`.

#### Review logs:

* Review your mainPointSystem logs: `wSpy.logs.mainPointSystem`
* Review whole wSpy logs: `wSpy.merged()`
* Most of the time you'll have much logs, and for this manner we have `search`:
  - `wSpy.search('layout')` - would return any logs with layout mention (logNames, stacktraces)
  - `wSpy.search(/layout|render/)` - search supports also regexes
* Get recent `x` logs:
  - `wSpy.recent(50)` - return last 50 logs.
* Get grouped logs:
  - `wSpy.grouped()` - 
* Get purged logs:
  - `wSpy.purge(50)` - 

#### Clear logs:
When you have much logs, and want to view only logs from certain point, use `wSpy.clear()` in order to clear any log in wSpy.
